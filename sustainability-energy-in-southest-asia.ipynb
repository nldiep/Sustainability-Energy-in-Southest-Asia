However, the trend was reversed in 2016 as CO2 emissions increased by 28.46% from 0.48251 Mt to 0.61984 Mt in 2019.\n\nCO2 emissions in Thailand showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2019. The fastest growth was between 2000 and 2005, when emissions increased by 35.13%. The growth rate slowed in the following years, but emissions still increased by 7.63% from 2005 to 2010 and 12.64% from 2010 to 2015.

The peak emission was 49.14 kt in 2017.\n\nIn contrast, the Philippines, with lower primary energy consumption, had higher CO2 emissions. Between 2000 and 2005, CO2 emissions in the Philippines ranged from 72.1 kt to 76.67 kt. However, emissions declined to 67.47 kt in 2006.

These include:\n\nThe increasing use of renewable energy: Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, do not produce greenhouse gases, so they can help to reduce air pollution and climate change.\nThe increasing energy efficiency: Energy efficiency measures, such as improving insulation and using energy-efficient appliances, can help to reduce the amount of energy needed to power homes and businesses.\nIf these developments continue, Southeast Asia will be able to lessen its dependency on fossil fuels in the medium and long term, ensuring a more sustainable future for the region.","metadata":{}}]}
